# HumanActivityRecognitionMachineLearning
This study demonstrate the capabilities of a classifier trained based on  Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset.

Please use github document "PredictionHumanActivityRecognition.md" to visualize the study performed, code and results as it is more convenient than the compile HTML that could not be seen properly on Github platform.

If execution of the code is required:
- Download "pml-testing.csv" and "pml-training.csv" on your R working directory.
- Execute "PredictionHumanActivityRecognition.Rmd" file (R markdown file).

Enjoy!
