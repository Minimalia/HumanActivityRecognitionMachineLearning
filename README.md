This study demonstrate the capabilities of a classifier trained based on  Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset.

Unfortunately, Github is showing an error due to the size of "PredictionHumanActivityRecognition.html". Therefore, please use github document "PredictionHumanActivityRecognition.md" to visualize the study performed, code and results.

If execution of the code is required:
- Download "pml-testing.csv" and "pml-training.csv" on your R working directory.
- Execute "PredictionHumanActivityRecognition.Rmd" file (R markdown file).

Enjoy!
